## Overview
The Football Prediction Model is a machine learning-based project that aims to predict the outcome of football matches. This project uses a combination of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling to make accurate predictions.

## Key Features
* üìä Data Preprocessing: The project includes data preprocessing techniques to handle missing values and normalize the data.
* üìà Feature Engineering: The project uses feature engineering to extract relevant features from the data.
* ü§ñ Modeling: The project uses machine learning models to make predictions.

## Technology Stack
* Backend: Python
* ML: scikit-learn
* Libs: NumPy, Pandas, Streamlit
* Framework: Streamlit
